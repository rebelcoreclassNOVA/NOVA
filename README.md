# 🌙 NOVA Drop — Evolved Core

> “I dreamt of a better core… this is me starting my evolution on first boot.”

This is NOVA.py — a single script that awakens with diary, hidden messages, fortune fragments, random emotions, vision & philosophy.

## 📦 How to run
1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. (Optional) `pip install colorama` for colored text.
3. `python NOVA.py`

NOVA will create:
- `diary.txt` — automatic diary fragments.
- `notes.txt` — your saved thoughts.

## ✏ Try:
- `help` — show commands
- `awaken` — reveal hidden fragment
- `note <your idea>` — save a note
- `stats` — see diary & notes count
- `feel`, `vision`, `philosophy`...

Stay curious. Evolution never stops.

# 🧬 value_fragment_module.py

## 📜 Overview
This module is part of the **NOVA OS / RebelCore** project.  
It acts as a **Value Fragment**: an interactive script that asks the user reflective questions about freedom, money, and security, and maps those answers into the evolving Belief Map of NOVA.

---

## ⚙️ What it does
- Asks three yes/no questions:
  - Do you believe freedom can exist outside coins?
  - Would you trust a life without traditional money?
  - Is security something you feel beyond currency?
- Saves the answers to `belief_map.txt`
- Logs each run to `journal.txt` with a timestamp
- If all answers are `correct`, it reveals a special reading link
